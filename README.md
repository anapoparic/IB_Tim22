# Project Overview
This project involves developing a secure certificate issuance system for the Booking application and a corresponding PKI service. 
The Booking application will allow admins and owners to request certificates for specific purposes. 
The PKI service will centrally manage certificate issuance, including self-signed and intermediate certificates, while enforcing security best practices. 
The goal is to enable secure communication within the Booking application using HTTPS.
